        Help us prove that NoFap works by submitting anonymous data to the Global FapSperiment!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The Global Fapsperiment is an effort to deliver an objective approach of
        measuring the effects of abstinence of masturbation (NoFap) to Mood, Energy and Libido.
      </p>

      <p>Every day, <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://reddit.com/r/nofap', '_system')">Reddit's /r/NoFap</a> is filled with a vast amount of success stories. However, no studies have yet been conducted to prove any of the reported beneficial properties.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We therefore hope to contribute an awesome, free, real-time and open-source approach with a massive amount of subjects (including you)
        to hopefully show that NoFap is beneficial for mood and other parameters.
      </p>
      
      <p>
