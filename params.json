Then look no further! Our completely **open source**, multi platform NofApp App aims to complete this gap. Tracking your streaks of abstinence, your latest encounters under the sheets and even your psyche, although subjective (bluetooth brain implant will be kickstarted around 2020) is possible and encouraged.\r\n\r\n### On Google Play\r\nNofApp is completely free to download on the Google Play Store and gets updated as we devise and implement new features.\r\nGet your copy [NOW](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterarguruments.nofapp).\r\n\r\n### (Not yet) In the iTunes Appstore\r\nAt some point in the future we will release this glorious app in the iTunes Appstore.
